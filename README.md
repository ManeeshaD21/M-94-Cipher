# M-94-Cipher
<h1>Mechanics</h1>
<p>The M-94 cipher was a cyliner with many different lettered dics arranged in a cylinder. </p>
<h3> How It Works </h3>
<p>The M-94 was arranged in a way with each disc on the cylinder havign a different arrangement of the 26 letter roman alphabet and stamped with an identifying number. Messages are encrypted 25 letters at a time. Then, turning each disc individually, the operator aligned the letters in the message horizontally. Then, any one of the remaining lines around the cylinder was sent as the cipher. To decrypt it, each wheel was turned until one line matched a 25 letter block of ciphertext. The message would then appear on one of the other lines, which could be seen pretty easily, as it would be the only one that could be read. </p>
